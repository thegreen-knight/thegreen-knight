# My-Portfolio

My name is Josh and I am a programmer, security expert, and all around creative. I have been working in cybersecurity for
the last 4 years with a startup company. I have developed programs for that company but I have not published any of my own
programs so that is what I plan on doing here. I have a bunch of directories filled with programs that I built but never did anything with.

I'm interested in developing my personal brand as a programmer and security expert as a way to grow personally and professionally.

I'm currently improving my JavaScript skills because I recently built a program that pushed my JS knowledge farther and it has made me want to learn more.

### Programming Languages I am strong in
- PHP
- Python
- Bash
- JavaScript
- MySQL

### Programming Lanuages I know enough to get by
- HTML
- CSS
- Powershell
- Go
- Java

### Programs I have built but can't post
<b>User platform:</b> I built the backend of a online user platform for employees and client's to login to. The client's can view reports and send information to the company about their issue and employees can login, respond, input data, and upload files. The platform was built from the ground up not using any frameworks. Since it was built for a cybesecurity company it had to be as full proof as possible.

<b>Desktop application for documenting: </b>I built the backend of a desktop aplication that allows users to document processes for a certification. The application was built using ElectronJS. I created a custom database that the program uses on the user's machine. The idea was that the user would own their data and we wouldn't be responsible for maintaining any of it. I for the storage I developed a basic method of encrypting and decrypting the data to protect the data from being tampered with by other programs.
